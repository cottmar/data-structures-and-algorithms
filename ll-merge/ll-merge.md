# Linked List Merge
 take two linked lists as arguments. Zip the two linked lists together into one so that the nodes alternate between the two lists and return a reference to the head of the single list.


## Question
I understand conceptually that I need a temp variable and to put portions of the second list in the temp variable but i just can't wrap my head around a solution.
