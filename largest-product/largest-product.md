## CODEWAR #4 - LARGEST PRODUCT, AN ARRAY OF ARRAYS. 

I did the hour of whiteboarding but didn't finish my javascript solution or the testing. Submitting as is so I can work on this over the weekend. 

4/24 -- After the whiteboarding review with Vinicio, I have a much better understanding of this problem. The way he broke down the visualization of the columns and rows + 1 and -1, i'm able to better understand the problem and solution.
