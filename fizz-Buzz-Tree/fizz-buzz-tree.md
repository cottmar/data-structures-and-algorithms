#  FizzBuzzTree
Write a function called FizzBuzzTree which takes a tree as an argument.


## Challenge
Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, determine weather or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both, and change the value of each of the nodes respectively. Return the tree with itâ€™s news values...

# Naming
Due to an issue with conflicts not being resolved on github, I created a branch called fizz-buzz-tree1 but it is for my fizz-buzz-tree whiteboard.
