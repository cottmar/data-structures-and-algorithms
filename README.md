# Reverse an Array
To reverse an array without using .reverse, I would try to use a reverse for loop, meaning instead of iterating through with an i++, I will iterate through with an i--. Using the pop method, I would be able to take the last number from the array and push it into the new array, for the entire length. 

# Challenge
